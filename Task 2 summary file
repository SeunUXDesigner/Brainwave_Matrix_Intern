User Personas and Design Strategy for HealthSync ‚Äì A Healthcare App
As part of my UI/UX internship at Brainwave Matrix Solutions, I was tasked with designing a user-centered healthcare application ‚Äî HealthSync ‚Äî that helps users manage their health conditions, track medications, and communicate with healthcare providers. My process involved conducting research, identifying key user needs, and creating targeted design solutions that prioritize accessibility, ease of use, and real-world utility.

By focusing on these two personas, I ensured that HealthSync serves a diverse range of users ‚Äî from those who need clarity and support, to those who want speed and control. This helped shape a more inclusive and scalable design.
This experience grew my ability to design with empathy, apply accessibility best practices, and build for real people with real needs.
